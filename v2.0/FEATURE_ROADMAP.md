## 📊 **Example Conversations**

### **1. Initial Setup**
```
User: "I want to get healthier and lose some weight"
Bot: "Welcome to your nutrition journey! 🎯 Let's start by understanding your goals better.

What's your current weight and height? This helps me calculate your calorie needs."

User: "I'm 200 lbs and 5'10""
Bot: "Thanks! For healthy weight loss, I recommend losing 1-2 lbs per week. 
      At your stats, that's about 1,800-2,000 calories daily.

What's your activity level? (sedentary, light, moderate, active, very active)"

User: "I work a desk job but try to exercise 3 times a week"
Bot: "Perfect! That's moderate activity. I'll set your calorie target at 1,900 calories 
      with 150g protein to preserve muscle while losing fat.

What are your main nutrition goals? (weight loss, muscle gain, energy, health, etc.)"
```

### **2. Meal Logging**
```
User: "I just ate lunch"
Bot: "Great! Let's log your lunch. What did you eat? 
      You can describe it naturally like 'chicken salad with avocado'"

User: "I had grilled chicken with brown rice and broccoli"
Bot: "✅ Logged your lunch! Estimated nutrition:
      • Grilled chicken (4 oz): 180 cal, 35g protein
      • Brown rice (1/2 cup): 110 cal, 2g protein  
      • Broccoli (1 cup): 30 cal, 3g protein
      Total: 320 calories, 40g protein

You're doing great on protein! You've hit 40g so far today. 
      Your target is 150g - want suggestions for high-protein snacks?"
```

### **3. Proactive Coaching**
```
Bot: "Hey! 👋 It's been 4 hours since your last meal. 
      Time for a snack to keep your metabolism active!

Based on your goals, I suggest:
• Greek yogurt with berries (150 cal, 15g protein)
• Handful of almonds (160 cal, 6g protein)
• Protein shake (120 cal, 25g protein)

What sounds good to you?"
